DESCRIPTION
-----------
*WARNING* proxyio is still in beta stage, very unstable!

proxyio is a socket library that provides several common communication patterns.
It aims to make the networking layer scalable, and easy to use. proxyio is
implemented in C, now only support unix/linux, we will support windows and other
os platform in the near future.

For more details, see APIs:

linkxio:xpoll[7]
linkxio:sp[7]

The communication patterns, also called "scalability protocols", are basic blocks
for building distributed systems. By combining them you can create a vast array of
distributed applications. The following scalability protocols are provided in the
near future:

----------
BUS      simple many-to-many communication
REQREP   build clusters of stateless services to process user requests
PUBSUB   distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
----------

Scalability protocols are layered on top of the transport layer in the network stack
and implemented by endpoint.
    
The library exposes a BSD-socket-like C API to the applications.

It is licensed under MIT/X11 license.
