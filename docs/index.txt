DESCRIPTION
-----------
WARNING: proxyio is still in beta stage!

proxyio is a socket library that provides several common communication patterns.
It aims to make the networking layer scalable, and easy to use. proxyio is
implemented in C, now only support unix/linux, we will support windows and other
os platform in the near future.

The communication patterns, also called "scalability protocols", are basic blocks
for building distributed systems. By combining them you can create a vast array of
distributed applications. The following scalability protocols are currently
available:

    PAIR - simple one-to-one communication
    BUS - simple many-to-many communication
    REQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process user requests
    PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
    PIPELINE - aggregates messages from multiple sources and load balances them among
              many destinations
    SURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in a single go 

Scalability protocols are layered on top of the transport layer in the network stack.
At the moment, the library supports the following transports mechanisms:

    INPROC - transport within a process (between threads, etc.)
    IPC - transport between processes on a single machine
    TCP - network transport via TCP 

The library exposes a BSD-socket-like C API to the applications.
