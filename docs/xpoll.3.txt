xpoll(3)
==========

NAME
----
xpoll - I/O event notification facility for xio socket

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xio/poll.h>*

*struct xpoll_t *xpoll_create();*
*void xpoll_close(struct xpoll_t *po);*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
xpoll is a variant of epoll(2) that scales well to large numbers of watched
file descriptors.  The following xio calls are provided  to create and manage
an xpoll instance:

    * An xpoll instance created by xpoll_create(), which returns a xpoll_t
      pointerreferring to the xpoll instance.
      
    * Interest in particular xio socket's file descriptors is then registered
      via xpoll_ctl().  The set of file  descriptors  currently registered
      on an xpoll instance is sometimes called an xpoll set.
      
    * Finally, the actual wait is started by xpoll_wait().

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, A new xpoll instance is returned.  On error, null is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
------
*ENOMEM*::
No memory available.
