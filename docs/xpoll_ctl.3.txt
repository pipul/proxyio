xpoll_ctl(3)
==========

NAME
----
xpoll_ctl - control interface for an xpoll instance

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xio/poll.h>*

	  #define XPOLL_ADD 1
	  #define XPOLL_DEL 2
	  #define XPOLL_MOD 3
*int xpoll_ctl(struct xpoll_t *xp, int op, struct xpoll_event *ev);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This call performs control operations on the xpoll instance referred to by
the xp.  It requests that the operation op be performed for the target
xio socket descriptor: xd.

Valid values for the op argument are :

XPOLL_ADD
    Register the target xio socket descriptor xd on the xpoll instance referred
    to by xp and associate the event event with the internal xio socket descriptor
    linked to xd.

XPOLL_MOD
    Change the event event associated with the target xio socket. 

XPOLL_DEL
    Remove (deregister) the target xio socket descriptor from the epoll instance
    referred to by xp.

    The event argument describes the xio socket poll events.  The struct
    xpoll_event is defined as :

    ----
    struct xpoll_event {
        int xd;
	void *self;
	
	/* What xio socket events i care about ... */
    	uint32_t care;

	/* What events happened now */
	uint32_t happened;
    };
    ----

    The care member is a bit set composed using the following available event types:

    XPOLLIN:
	The associated xio socket is available for xrecv[3] operations.
    XPOLLOUT:
        The associated xio socket is available for xsend[3] operations.
    XPOLLERR:
        Error condition happened on the associated xio socket.  xpoll_wait[3] will
	always wait for this event; it is not necessary to set it in events.

	
RETURN VALUE
------------
When successful, xpoll_ctl() returns zero.  When an error occurs, xpoll_ctl()
returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
------
*EEXIST*::
op was XPOLL_ADD, and the supplied xio socket is already registered with this
xpoll instance.
*EINVAL*::
the requested operation op is not supported by this interface.

*ENOENT*::
op was XPOLL_MOD or XPOLL_DEL, and xio socket is not registered on with this
xpoll instance.

*ENOMEM*::
There was insufficient memory to handle the requested op control operation.
