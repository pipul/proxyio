xsocket(3)
============

NAME
----
xsocket - create an xsock


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xio/sock.h>*

*int xsocket(int 'pf', int 'socktype');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates an xsocket with specified 'pf' and 'socktype'. Returns a file
descriptor for the newly created xsocket.

Following pfs are defined at the moment:

*XPF_NET*::
TCP transport mechanism

*XPF_IPC*::
inter-process transport mechanism

*XPF_INP*::
in-process transport mechanism


'socktype' parameter defines the type of the socket, which in turn determines
the exact semantics of the socket. 

Following socktypes are defined at the moment:

*XLISTENER*::
xsocket listener, that is, as a xsocket that will be used to accept incoming
connection requests using xbind[3] or using helper API xlisten[3]

*XCONNECTOR*::
xsocket connector, a xsocket that will be used to connect to remote listening
xsocket using xbind[3] or using helper API xconnect[3]

The newly created xsocket is initially not associated with any endpoints.
In order to establish a message flow at least one endpoint has to be added
to the socket using linkxio:xbind[3] function.

RETURN VALUE
------------
If the function succeeds file descriptor of the new xsocket is returned.
Otherwise, -1 is returned and 'errno' is set to to one of the values defined
below.

Note that file descriptors returned are not standard system file descriptors
and will exhibit undefined behaviour when used with system functions.
Moreover, it may happen that a system file descriptor and file descriptor of
an xsocket will incidentally collide (be equal).


ERRORS
------
*EPROTO*::
Specified address family is not supported or unknown protocol.
*EMFILE*::
The limit on the total number of open xsockets or OS limit for file
descriptors has been reached.

EXAMPLE
-------

----
int s = xsocket (XPF_NET, XLISTENER);

or

int s = xsocket (XPF_NET|XPF_IPC, XLISTENER);
