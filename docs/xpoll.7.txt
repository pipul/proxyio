xpoll(7)
========

NAME
----
xpoll - I/O event notification facility for xio socket

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xio/poll.h>*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
xpoll is a variant of epoll(2) that scales well to large numbers of watched +
xio socket descriptors.  The following xio calls are provided  to create +
and manage an xpoll instance:

    * An xpoll instance created by xpoll_create[3], which returns a xpoll_t +
      pointerreferring to the xpoll instance.
      
    * Interest in particular xio socket descriptors is then registered +
      via xpoll_ctl().  The set of xio socket descriptors currently registered +
      on an xpoll instance is sometimes called an xpoll set.
      
    * Finally, the actual wait is started by xpoll_wait().
