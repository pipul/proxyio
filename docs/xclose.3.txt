by the application will be discarded. The library will try to deliver any
outstanding outbound messages for the time specified by _XLINGER_ xsocket option.
The call will block in the meantime.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, 0 is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.

The provided socket is invalid.
*EINTR*::
Operation was interrupted by a signal. The socket is not fully closed yet.
Operation can be re-started by calling _xclose()_ again.
