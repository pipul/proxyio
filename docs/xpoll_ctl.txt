xpoll_ctl(3)
==========

NAME
----
xpoll_ctl - control interface for an xpoll instance

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xio/poll.h>*

*#define XPOLL_ADD 1*
*#define XPOLL_DEL 2*
*#define XPOLL_MOD 3*

*int xpoll_ctl(struct xpoll_t *xp, int op, struct xpoll_event *ev);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This call performs control operations on the xpoll instance referred to by
the xp.  It requests that the operation op be performed for the target
xsocket descriptor: xd.

Valid values for the op argument are :

XPOLL_ADD
    Register the target xsocket descriptor xd on the xpoll instance referred
    to by xp and associate the event event with the internal xsocket descriptor
    linked to xd.

XPOLL_MOD
    Change the event event associated with the target xsocket. 

XPOLL_DEL
    Remove (deregister) the target xsocket descriptor from the epoll instance
    referred to by xp.

    The event argument describes the xsocket poll events.  The struct
    xpoll_event is defined as :
    
    struct xpoll_event {
        int xd;
	void *self;
	
	/* What xsocket events i care about ... */
    	uint32_t care;

	/* What events happened now */
	uint32_t happened;
    };

    The care member is a bit set composed using the following available
    event types:
    XPOLLIN:
	The associated xsocket is available for xrecv[3] operations.
    XPOLLOUT:
        The associated file is available for xsend[3] operations.
    XPOLLERR:
        Error condition happened on the associated xsocket.  xpoll_wait[3] will
	always wait for this event; it is not necessary to set it in events.

RETURN VALUE
------------
When successful, xpoll_ctl() returns zero.  When an error occurs, xpoll_ctl()
returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
------
*EEXIST*::
op was XPOLL_ADD, and the supplied xsocket is already registered with this
xpoll instance.
*EINVAL*::
the requested operation op is not supported by this interface.

*ENOENT*::
op was XPOLL_MOD or XPOLL_DEL, and xsocket is not registered on with this
xpoll instance.

*ENOMEM*::
There was insufficient memory to handle the requested op control operation.
