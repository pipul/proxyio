xpoll_create(3)
===============

NAME
----
xpoll_create - open an xpoll instance

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xio/poll.h>*

*int xpoll_create();*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
xpoll_create() returns a file descriptor referring to the new xpoll instance.
This file descriptor is used for all the subsequent calls to the xpoll interface.
When no longer required, the file descriptor returned by xpoll_create() should
be closed by using xpoll_close(2). When all file descriptors referring to an xpoll
instance have been closed, the kernel destroys the instance and releases the
associated resources for re-use.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, A new xpoll instance is returned.  On error, null is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
------
*ENOMEM*::
No memory available.
