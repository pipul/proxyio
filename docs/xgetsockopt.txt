NAME
----
xgetsockopt - retrieve a xsocket option


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <xio/sock.h>*

*int xgetsockopt (int 's', int 'level', int 'option', void '*val',
    size_t '*vallen');*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves the value for the 'option'. The 'level' argument specifies the
protocol level at which the option resides. For generic socket-level
options use _XSOCKET_ level. For transport-specific options use ID of the
transport as the 'level' argument (e.g. _XTCP_).

The value is stored in the buffer pointed to by 'val' argument. Size of the
buffer is specified by the 'vallen' argument. If the size of the option is
greater than size of the buffer, the value will be silently truncated.
Otherwise, the 'vallen' will be modified to indicate the actual length of
the option.

_<xio/sock.h>_ header defines generic xsocket options (_XSOCKET_ level).
The options are as follows:

*XPF*::
    Returns the address family constant as it was passed to _xsocket()_.
*XSOCKTYPE*::
    Returns the protocol constant as it was passed to _xsocket()_.
*XNOBLOCK*::
    Send/Recv on Non-blocking mode
*XLINGER*::
    Specifies how long should the socket try to send pending outbound messages
    after _xclose()_ have been called, in milliseconds. Negative value means
    infinite linger. The type of the option is int. Default value is 1000 (1s).
*XSNDBUF*::
    Size of the send buffer, in bytes. To prevent blocking for messages larger
    than the buffer, exactly one message may be buffered in addition to the data
    in the send buffer. The type of this option is int. Default value is 128kB.
*XRCVBUF*::
    Size of the receive buffer, in bytes. To prevent blocking for messages
    larger than the buffer, exactly one message may be buffered in addition
    to the data in the receive buffer. The type of this option is int. Default
    value is 128kB.
*XSNDTIMEO*::
    The timeout for send operation on the socket, in milliseconds. If message
    cannot be sent within the specified timeout, EAGAIN error is returned.
    Negative value means infinite timeout. The type of the option is int.
    Default value is -1.
*XRCVTIMEO*::
    The timeout for recv operation on the socket, in milliseconds. If message
    cannot be received within the specified timeout, EAGAIN error is returned.
    Negative value means infinite timeout. The type of the option is int.
    Default value is -1.
*XRECONNECT_IVL*::
    For connection-based transports such as TCP, this option specifies how
    long to wait, in milliseconds, when connection is broken before trying
    to re-establish it. Note that actual reconnect interval may be randomised
    to some extent to prevent severe reconnection storms. The type of the option
    is int. Default value is 100 (0.1 second).
*XRECONNECT_IVL_MAX*::
    This option is to be used only in addition to _XRECONNECT_IVL_ option.
    It specifies maximum reconnection interval. On each reconnect attempt,
    the previous interval is doubled until _XRECONNECT_IVL_MAX_ is reached.
    Value of zero means that no exponential backoff is performed and reconnect
    interval is based only on _XRECONNECT_IVL_. If _XRECONNECT_IVL_MAX_ is
    less than _XRECONNECT_IVL_, it is ignored. The type of the option is int.
    Default value is 0.
*XSOCKETKEY*::
    Socket name for error reporting and statistics. The type of the option
    is string. Default value is "socket.N" where N is socket integer.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.


ERRORS
------
*EBADF*::
The provided socket is invalid.
*EINVAL*::
The option is unknown or option is invalid.
